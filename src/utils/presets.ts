They believe that Rao chooses this time to separate the sinful from the righteous in the afterworld. There is also a prophecy in the Raoan holy text, the Book of Incarum, that claims that Rao will cleanse the world of evil on this night, sometime in the future.\n\nThe priesthood of Kurell consider it holy, too, calling it Kurell's Night, requiring the faithful to undertake special missions on this night to prove their cleverness and skill. Kurell smiles particularly on acts of theft or vengeance performed on his holy night, blessing those who do so successfully. Donations to Kurell's church are encouraged afterwards, for Kurell may take vengeance against those who do not properly thank him for his aid.\n\nMost other people regard Dark Night as a time of ill omen, fearing it as much as the night of the Blood Moon Festival. Bonfires are burned from dusk till dawn, particularly in small villages and in Elmshire and Narwell. Orc and goblin religions view it as an excellent night for raiding settlements. Certain evil cults perform kidnappings, murders, and vile rites during this period.

Wizards and Sorcerers then perform feats of illusion and magic trying to outdo one another with their displays. Usually there is a panel of judges to decide, in the larger cities there is usually a limit of 5-person teams competing. Each performance during the Desportium of Magic uses a long established theme, that of an attack on the town by various monsters and Dark Elves, repelled by brave warriors and spellcasters. The displays, made up of any number of spells cast without the use of magic devices, cannot actually cause any harm to property or people, but must be as wonderful, striking, detailed, and lifelike as possible.\n\nThis motif is based on actual attacks through the years from the Uttermost War to the most recent Great Slave Raids. The idea is to make the attackers as dreadful as possible and the defenders as heroic as possible, secondary is to make sure that people will always remember the terror of the Uttermost War. In large cities like the CSIO and CSWE and Tarantis, these performances last all night and are amazing to watch. In smaller villages without spellcasters, puppet plays are often done in its stead.",

Only essential work is done on this day. Many merchants close their shops on Giving Day as well out of respect for the Sun Father and his teachings. Gambling houses are closed, but not hostelries, for Giving Day is a day of feasting and goodwill, a time for enjoying the fruits of the Oerth.\n\nPublic services are held from dawn until noon by Pelor's priests, outdoors if the weather permits (which if almost always does, as the clerics use weather-controlling magic for maximum sunlight). Even Greyhawk City's large temple of Pelor is not big enough to hold the throngs who come to celebrate on this day, so throngs of the faithful fill the temple grounds in the Garden Quarter, spilling out from the Millstream to the Nobles' Wall, and to the road leading toward Greyhawk's Grand Theater. Many come, of course, for the free meal the priests provide after the service. The Pelorian priests are well aware of this, but believe that for the needy, a full stomach must come before wisdom and learning. Members of Greyhawk's Guild of Thieves and Beggar's Union, many of whom remember Midsummer's Day fondly from their orphaned childhoods, both protect priests of Pelor on this day, and woe onto those who attempt to test them on this matter.\n\nPriests of Pelor, bedecked in yellow and gold, parade about the streets, demanding donations for their charitable works, freely using guilt to squeeze more from stingy purses. Free healings are given out, particularly to children. Most Greyhawkers wear at least one item of yellow cloth on this day out of respect.\n\nSome crusading Pelorians crusade against evil lycanthropes on this night, since both Celene and Luna are full.",

On the final day, a living sacrifice is made to the Dark Prince, after the victim is pampered and pleasured for the ten days prior. The sacrifice can either be an enemy or a great devotee of the church, and is kept alive for as long as possible during the torture using magic. This holiday often involves fortune-telling as a part of the torture, using the victim's entrails or their cries of pain to determine the Midnight Lord's will. Occasionally it is believed that the sacrifice will prophesy with the voice of Zon-Kuthon himself.",

The entrants fight in rounds until at last one stands alone.

Despite weariness after a full day planting, many farming communities hold celebrations come the night: feasting, dancing and courtship feature showing the cycle of nature.",

                    "Abadar\n\nNo one enjoys paying taxes but the collection of fair taxes is considered an integral part of the maintenance of society, and is therefore holy to the god Abadar. Every year on the 15th of Gozran, priests of the church of Abadar spend the day walking city streets, doing what they can to make the bitter pill of annual taxes a bit easier to swallow.\n\nThe Business of the Day\n\nFrom dawn to dusk, clerics of Abadar attend the tax collectors of sizeable communities as the tax wagons roll from door to door. The church officials monitor these activities to make sure that the process is conducted respectfully and justly, and that citizens know that the process is monitored. More than just aiding in the yearly errand, the faithful personally thank every citizen for contributing to the improvement of their city, extol the public works funded by their contributions, and foretell the grandeur of civic projects to come. The disenfranchised and destitute they attempt to comfort as best they can, quoting from their god's dogma on work and worthiness, but this is not a day for discounts or deferrals. The citizens are able to voice their concerns and ideas as to where the monies levied should best be applied. Citizens are free to speak their mind on any issue here without fear of repercussion.\n\nThe Celebrations of the Day\n\nAt dusk, the Abadarans host several celebrations in parks, plazas, and other communal areas about the city, organizing donations and contributions from local vendors to feed and entertain all-comers. Having already preached to most of the city over the course of the day, the clerics perform only a brief opening ceremony, dedicating the feast to Abadar, the city, and its great people. These celebrations are often quite distinct from neighbourhood to neighbourhood and are almost always divided along economic boundaries.\n\nThe festivities involving the wealthiest citizens usually happen on the steps of city hall or other grand civic buildings and feature the best music and food, but often little more than polite card and guessing games. These galas usually wrap up by midnight.\n\nFor the common folk, the parks and marketplaces take on a carnival atmosphere, with simple but good food, local ales, performances by talented citizens, and games of chance going on well into the night. A prevailing superstition through these festivals is that, during the celebration, it is lucky to kiss—or in some regions, pinch—a cleric of Abadar, leading to many a rosy-cheeked cleric.\n\nEven the city's poor are given reason to celebrate, as the local temple of Abadar hosts a cheery but unabashedly religious gathering on its steps, feeding all comers, doling out a hearty ration of wine, singing hymns of the faith, and providing tokens for a second wine ration for any who return to attend a service within the month.\n\nFor a holiday that revolves around paying taxes, this Abadaran festival is not as reviled as one might expect.",

The celebration — once dedicated to the god Aroden — is still important to the faithful of Iomedae, who use it to train commoners in combat, ordain apprentice clergy, pick squires for knights, and teach military history, hoping to prevent the mistakes of the past from being repeated. Among those not dedicated to the Inheritor the holiday has lost most of its religious significance since Aroden's death, tending now only toward wild partying, a fact that has precluded the diabolist authorities of Cheliax from prohibiting Armasse outright. Nevertheless, in places where the church of Asmodeus is openly allowed, it hosts special activities for its parishioners during the same week in an effort to counter the influence of the holiday. The city of Corentyn is especially known for its extravagant Armasse festivities.",

                    "Erastil\n\nArcher's Day or Archerfeast is a holiday of the god Erastil held annually on the 3rd of Erastus. Despite the holiday's origins in the worship of Erastil, common country folk from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings to Taldor celebrate the height of summer with a day set aside for establishing new relationships, enjoying current camaraderie, and celebrating the gifts of the gods. Archery competitions are held frequently in which the men test their skill with the bow through progressively harder trials. The exact form of competition is different from place to place, and the winner is awarded a rack of elk horns and a quiver of blessed arrows. He is also given the title of \"Protector\", which he holds until the next year.\n\nWhile the festival's traditions emphasize contests of marksmanship, most have expanded to exhibit talents of all types, from baking and storytelling to racing and mock combat. Aside from encouraging a fair-like atmosphere, many of the displays and competitions serve one of two secondary purposes: either as a way for merchants to show off their superior livestock and wares, or (more popularly) as a way for eligible men and women to show off to each other.\n\nWhile the day's events at most Archerfeast fairs are filled with games, food, and crafts, the night brings dancing, drinking, pranks, and the crowning of the princes and princesses of spring and summer for the two single youths and two single adults who fared best in the day's events. The festivities continue late into the evening, but end promptly at midnight, so that in true Erastilian fashion the next day's responsibilities are not overly impeded. For those not of Erastil's flock, however, private parties, drinking, and trysting carry on long into the next morning.",

Observances of the holiday vary, but often include firework displays, feats of strength, and public debates to showcase speaking and rhetorical skills.\n\nAs Cheliax degenerated to civil war and diabolism after 4606 AR, blood pacts and infernal contracts also began to be signed on this day. As a result of Cheliax's new affiliation, Andoran and Galt began to distance themselves from Cheliax and the original interpretation of the holiday. In Andoran it continues to be the day that most national laws take effect as well as being a traditional day of marriage, and the date on which new Steel Falcons are inducted.",

The day marks the anniversary of the day Iomedae took the Test of the Starstone in the autumn of 3832 AR and ascended to godhood.\n\nCelebration\n\nThe day is a joyous celebration for the faithful, with singing, pledging of friendships, and forgiving of old grudges.\n\nTo many, the Test of the Starstone represents the greatest of all challenges, yet for Iomedae it was one of three storied promotions in her rise from Aroden's herald to a goddess in her own right. On the 6th of Lamashan, the Inheritor's faithful observe the heroism of Iomedae's life before her moment of ascension and celebrate the anniversary of the apotheosis itself.\n\nThe celebration takes place in several stages. Early in the day, troupes of performers—as often passionate amateurs as professionals—stage morality plays featuring the Eleven Acts of Iomedae, the heroic near-miracles and sacrifices she made leading up to her trials in the Starstone Cathedral. Scripts vary by region, city, and even neighborhood, but despite differences in setting, performance medium, and word choice, the themes and morals are all the same.\n\nAs the day continues, the priests organize jousts and mock battles, allowing anyone to participate so long as she can demonstrate enough skill to not be a risk to herself or others. The winners of these contests then face tests of mental acuity such as solving riddles, deciphering philosophical quandaries, and answering questions of honor and justice. Those who prove themselves in both contests are awarded a white cloak—representing the Inheritor at peace—styled after Iomedae's own red garment to wear for the rest of the celebration. Feasting and singing follow the competitions, mirroring the jubilation that followed Iomedae's ascension. This is occasion for making pledges of friendship and forgiving enemies, and priests circulate about the crowd offering the Inheritor's blessing to those who do and providing a moment's counsel or mediation for those who need an extra nudge.\n\nThe celebration typically ends before midnight, and the following day the priests and previous day's champions gather up the blunted swords from the mock battles, sharpen them, and distribute them among the church's armory and those of like-minded organizations so that all may remain vigilant against evil and prepared to strike it down.",

The holiday was originally intended to distract the distraught Taldan populace with a night of revelry and comedic entertainment, but the antics of jesters were simply not enough.\n\nOver the course of the first few years, Jestercap evolved from a holiday of observation to a holiday of participation. Today, the holiday is a time where anyone can pull pranks or jokes or japes on companions, on neighbors, and (most typically) on rivals, with the understanding that provided no lasting harm is done, any humiliations inflicted before midnight are to be taken in stride. Of course, come morning the day after, there are inevitably jokes that went too far, and grudges and feuds borne from Jestercap antics have a way of lingering for months to follow.\n\nIn Religion\n\nFollowers of Chaldira Zuzaristan, a halfling deity of mischief, treat Jestercap as a holy day and their pranks — often elaborate and extravagant in nature and plotted for months in advance — as displays of their faith.",

                    "Sivanah\n\nThe holiday known as Seven Veils, which takes place on the 23rd of Neth in most realms of the Inner Sea region, is a celebration of the region's diversity — a time when social boundaries break down even further in a day-long event filled with dancing, feasting, and courting. The evening traditionally closes out with the Seven Veil masquerade, a ball wherein the participants wear disguises that hide their race or gender (often using minor magical trinkets and spells) or disguise these features as entirely new characteristics. At the end of the ball, the participants remove their disguises to their partners, often with unpredictable and sometimes delightfully awkward results. Traditionalists and conservative minds often find the Seven Veils masquerades to be scandalous or off-putting, yet they remain particularly popular in most of the larger cities of the land.\n\nHistorians note that the original \"Dance of the Seven Veils\" has a much different genesis than one promoting diversity — the mysterious cult of Sivanah, goddess of illusions, mystery, and reflections, is generally cited as the source of this festival, and indeed, worshippers of the goddess (herself known as the Seventh Veil) count the 23rd of Neth as one of their most sacred of days. What rituals the church of Sivanah performs on this date, however, are unknown to outsiders, for the cult enjoys its secrets. This secrecy has, unsurprisingly, given rise to all manner of sinister rumour, yet when Seven Veils rolls around each year, its eager participants are quick to set aside rumour in preference for the night's fun and games.",

Evoking Day is observed on the 18th of Neth, and while this holiday is mostly celebrated in Garund, temples dedicated to Nethys host celebrations throughout the Inner Sea region. Traditional celebrations of Evoking Day have changed over the thousands of years since its first incarnation, but to this day every occurrence of Evoking Day still features a grand meal shared by celebrants during the afternoon and a wondrous exhibition of brilliant and explosive magic once the sun sets. These days, such colorful magical displays are augmented with fireworks of a dozen different colors and patterns.\n\nIn temples of Nethys dedicated to revering evocation magic, priests and prominent arcanists participate in spell duels where each contestant stands on a raised platform and takes turns trying to incapacitate her opponent. The magic wielded in theses duels favors the flashy over the dangerous, but clerics of Nethys are on hand to treat any injuries. These duels gather large crowds eager to lend their applause to their favorite contestant.\n\nIt is also during this festival when wizards who worship Nethys open their spellbooks to others who share their craft. Wizards normally guard their spellbooks with their lives and covet the eldritch information therein, but on Evoking Day these wizards meet with one another prior to the afternoon feast to share their spells just as they prepare to share a grand meal.\n\nThough Evoking Day is primarily a day of grand magic, those with no spellcasting talent still flock to local temples of Nethys to partake in the shared feast and flashy evening displays of magic and fireworks. Between the meal and into the night, celebrants wear black-and-white robes and perform joyous dances meant to give thanks to the wonders Nethys brought to humankind. These dances are grand affairs involving dozens of dancers all spinning and clapping to the accompanying music as their black-and-white robes fan out around them with each spin. As night descends and the fireworks and magical displays begin, the dancing rises to a climax erupting in shouts and calls to Nethys with each thunderous boom.",

                    "Not all of Golarion's holidays and festivals are times of rejoicing and delight. Holidays worshiped by dark and sinister cults and religions tend to be hidden affairs, their rituals and ceremonies involving cruelties and vile practices that send shivers of fear through gentler society. Scholars suspect that the Night of the Pale—a holiday that traditionally takes place on the last day of the year, the 31st of Kuthona—has links to several sinister religions, but today no one church has specific association with the event. Nonetheless, the Night of the Pale is an event that many look forward to all year, whether in fear or excitement.\n\nOn the Night of the Pale, it is said that the ghosts of those who died during the previous year manifest upon the world and come to visit the homes they lived in during life. Although some might think that the chance of seeing even the shade of a dearly departed one might be a blessing, the Night of the Pale is not a time for tearful reunions, for these ghosts, tradition says, do not return out of love for those they left behind but out of darker compulsions. Lingering jealousy, unfinished arguments, or the simmering need for revenge are said to be what compels the dead to return to torment the living on the Night of the Pale.\n\nThe evening of this night in many communities is celebrated by a morbid feast, the food prepared with themes revolving around graveyards, the dead, and other spooky traditions. This feast, on one level, helps the celebrants to make light of their fears while sharing good company with similarly nervous neighbors, but at another level is believed to placate vengeful spirits as toasts are raised to the memories of the recently departed. These feasts include retellings of favorite memories of the departed, in hopes of reminding the approaching ghosts of brighter and kinder memories than those that compel them to return. The feast always ends at least an hour before midnight in order to give participants time to return home, decorate doors and windows with salt and other trinkets taken from the feasting table (salted bread baked into crook-like shapes are a favorite, as these can be hung from doorknobs and eaves) to ward off evil spirits, and hide in their bedrooms until dawn. Brave youths and adventurers often deliberately stay out after midnight, either to dare the ghosts to challenge them or simply for the thrill of bucking tradition. Every Night of the Pale, it seems, there are disappearances among those who stay out after midnight, although whether these vanishings are the result of dissatisfied locals taking the opportunity to run away from home, murderers or wild animals or other mundane dangers, or the vengeful spirits carrying off their victims depends upon the circumstances.\n\nThe morning after a Night of the Pale is also the first day of the new year—a time that many celebrate more as a relief for surviving the night before than in anticipation of what the new year might bring, although regional preferences for how this day is celebrated vary enough that no single tradition holds over the other. Save, of course, the lingering fears of what dread spirits might come knocking upon warded doors one year away...",

It is held on both the summer and winter solstices.\n\nFollowers of the Song of Spheres gather at dusk and light enormous bonfires and hold feasts, watching the sparks and embers float out into the darkening sky. After it is fully dark, the celebrants chant and sing songs as they watch the fires burn low. When only embers remain, sand mixed with ground star gems (either star rubies, star sapphires, or rose quartz) is thrown on them or into the air downwind. At this point it is common to make proclamations of love and friendship and of promised journeys to come. The twinkling of the sand is thought to mirror the night sky and demonstrate Desna's witnessing of these pronouncements.",

                    "The Feast of the Moon, or Moonfest, was an annual festival in the Calendar of Harptos, occurring between the final night of Uktar and the first day of Nightal. It was the last great festival of the calendar year.\n\nThe day traditionally marked the onset of winter. It was also a time to celebrate and honor the ancestors and the respected dead. On this day, folk blessed their ancestors' graves and performed the Ritual of Remembrance. People also gathered to tell stories of the deeds of their ancestors and of the gods until deep into the night, until they merged and became legend. This was a time to hear of past heroes, great treasures, and lost cities.\n\nIn FaerÃƒÂ»n, battles were typically fought between harvest-time and the coming of winter. This meant that most of the fighting usually occurred in the month of Uktar. The timing of the Feast of the MoonÃ¢â‚¬â€after recently slain soldiers had joined the ranks of the deadÃ¢â‚¬â€was thus practical, if sadly ironic.\n\nThe Heralds of FaerÃƒÂ»n had a number of special duties on the Feast of the Moon. Prime among these was to perform the Bloodsong ceremony, at which a Herald publicly recited the genealogies of each noble family in the area. In this way, the Heralds reaffirmed a noble family's traditional authority and status, as well as the respect accorded to them.\n\nPriests of a number of deities of various pantheons held rites, ceremonies, and festivals on the Feast of the Moon. Many, though not all, focused on remembering the dead in one way or another.",

                    'Highharvestide was an annual festival in the Calendar of Harptos, taking place between 30 Eleint and 1 Marpenoth. It was traditionally a feast to celebrate the harvest and the abundance of food, but also the time when those wishing to travel left on their journeys before winter set in.\n\nPreparations for the feast started as early as a tenday before, while preparing, cooking, and preserving the harvest for the cold winter months. Traditions varied from community to community, but examples of festive activity included food-related contests; races and challenges of skill and strength; receiving homemade sweets from the local clergy; and priests blessing larders, wine cellars, grain bins, and food preserves.\n\nThis day was often an important anniversary to various governments. Often, taxes and tithes came due, rulers held "open courts" to hear the concerns of their citizens, oaths were publicly renewed, troops received marching orders to new duty stations, and guilds met to confer on prices and rate changes for goods and services.\n\nAccording to tradition, dwarves only drank water and elves drank only dew on this day. However, these traditions began to fade in the 14th and 15th century DR.\n\nIt was said that children born on this day were favored by Tymora to have lifelong good luck but be smitten with wanderlust. Another legend was that human females born on this day had control over their reproductive system (i.e., got pregnant only when they wanted to) by force of will alone, and that they could instantly sense when they had been poisoned, either by ingestion or being bitten by a venomous creature for example.',

This solemn ceremony consists of an assembly wherein the clergy discuss the previous year's campaigns. Strategies are discussed, battles analyzed, and the accumulated lore integrated into the church's teachings.\n\nThe holiest day of the year for the Church of Shevarash is Midwinter Night, during which the Dark Court Slaughter is remembered. Inductions into the ranks of the clergy occur at this time. Each new cleric screams vows of vengeance into the night air and swears neither to laugh nor smile until the Spider Queen and her followers are no more.",
